Intro:

Hello everyone, my name is John Booth and this is my specializations capstone! 
I'm a former welding and carpentry shop foreman turned Web Developer and I wanted to 
create a project that is rooted in a real world application that a company would use.

Features:

To start, we need to login to the site!

Now, I'm really big into organization and having information easily accessible so the first step to doing that
is to add a sales rep. **** Click add rep **** This is where we can add a rep to the company and their ID 
will automatically apply to the new rep from the backend SQL. **** Submit the rep ****

**** Click home ****

We can check the reps that are currently in the system **** Click rep list **** and we can delete or edit the rep's information

**** Click home ****

Now that we have a new rep we can simulate them adding a customer **** Click add customer ****
We can add in the customer's information to save it to the database **** Fill out customer info and submit ****

**** Click home ****

We can also the all of the customers in the database **** Click customer list **** where we can also edit or delete the customer's info
**** Edit new customer ****
Same as the reps, we can edit any of the information here as well as update the associated rep if need be **** Change and submit ****
All of this is using the front end inputs that communicate with the backend logic to create, edit and remove information from our databases.

**** Click home ****

Those are the main features of my project for now! I really enjoyed learning more about setting up my own databases and being able to
have all of my databases connected and working dynamically together to give the site a clean and smooth feel for the user!
