# Capstone || Web Development Spec
The idea behind my capstone is to allow sals reps to log in to their accounts, add their customer's information and be able to track the order, flag customer's for payment and remove customer's.

# MVP
<li> Account login - Done </li>
<li> Users can view their customers </li>
<li> Users can add comments on customer profiles </li>
<li> Customers can be added to database where all can be viewable by admins </li>
<li> Reps can flag customer's accounts that need payment or installation </li>
